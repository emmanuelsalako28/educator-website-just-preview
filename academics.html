                    Choosing the right school is a pivotal moment in your child's life. It sets the tone for their
                    academic and personal growth, shaping who they become as learners and individuals. At St. Peters
                    School, we recognize the significance of this decision and strive to provide an educational
                    experience that nurtures our students' potential in every facet of their lives.

                        At St. Peters School, we understand that choosing a Creche for your child is an important
                        decision,
                        as it marks the beginning of their educational journey. Our Creche stage, which comprises of
                        children aged three months to four years old, is split into three sub-stages: Creche,
                        Pre-Kindergarten, and Kindergarten. Each stage is designed to cater to the unique needs of your
                        child, ensuring they receive the best possible start to their education. Our
                        Creche program is specially designed to meet the needs of infants aged three months to one year
                        old.
